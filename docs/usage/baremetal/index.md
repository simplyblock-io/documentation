`{{ variables.cliname }}` is the official command line interface (CLI) for managing simplyblock management and storage
clusters. It provides administrators with a powerful and flexible tool to perform essential storage operations directly
from the terminal, enabling full control over logical volumes (LVs) and the simplyblock environment. With
`{{ variables.cliname }}`, common tasks such as provisioning, cloning, resizing, and encrypting logical volumes are
efficiently executed with clear, consistent commands.
