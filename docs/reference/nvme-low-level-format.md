NVMe devices store data in configurable sized blocks. Simplyblock expects NVMe devices to provide 4 KB block internal
block size. Hence, to prevent data loss in case of a sudden power outage, NVMe devices must be formatted for a
specific LBA format.

!!! danger
    Failing to format NVMe devices with the correct LBA format can lead to data loss or data corruption in the case
    of a sudden power outage or other loss of power.

The `lsblk` is the best way to find all NVMe devices attached to a system.

```plain title="Example output of lsblk"
[demo@demo-3 ~]# sudo lsblk
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda           8:0    0   30G  0 disk
├─sda1        8:1    0    1G  0 part /boot
└─sda2        8:2    0   29G  0 part
  ├─rl-root 253:0    0   26G  0 lvm  /
  └─rl-swap 253:1    0    3G  0 lvm  [SWAP]
nvme3n1     259:0    0  6.5G  0 disk
nvme2n1     259:1    0   70G  0 disk
nvme1n1     259:2    0   70G  0 disk
nvme0n1     259:3    0   70G  0 disk
```

In the example, we see four NVMe devices. Three devices of 70GiB and one device with 6.5GiB storage capacity.

To find the correct LBA format (_lbaf_) for each of the devices, the `nvme` cli can be used.

```bash title="Show NVMe namespace information"
sudo nvme id-ns /dev/nvmeXnY
```

The output depends on the NVMe device itself, but looks something like this:

```plain title="Example output of NVMe namespace information"
[demo@demo-3 ~]# sudo nvme id-ns /dev/nvme0n1
NVME Identify Namespace 1:
...
lbaf  0 : ms:0   lbads:9  rp:0
lbaf  1 : ms:8   lbads:9  rp:0
lbaf  2 : ms:16  lbads:9  rp:0
lbaf  3 : ms:64  lbads:9  rp:0
lbaf  4 : ms:0   lbads:12 rp:0 (in use)
lbaf  5 : ms:8   lbads:12 rp:0
lbaf  6 : ms:16  lbads:12 rp:0
lbaf  7 : ms:64  lbads:12 rp:0
```

From this output, the required _lbaf_ configuration can be found. The necessary configuration has to have the following
values:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| ms       | 0     |
| lbads    | 12    |
| rp       | 0     |

In the example, the required LBA format is 4. If a NVMe device doesn't have that combination, any other lbads=12
combination will work. However, simplyblock recommends to ask for the best available combination.

In our example, the device is already formatted with the correct _lbaf_ (see the "in use"). It is, however,
recommended to always format the device before use.

To format the drive, the `nvme` cli is used again.

```bash title="Formatting the NVMe device"
sudo nvme format --lbaf=<lbaf> --ses=0 /dev/nvmeXnY
```

The output of the command should give a successful response when executing similar to the below example.

```plain title="Example output of NVMe device formatting"
[demo@demo-3 ~]# sudo nvme format --lbaf=4 --ses=0 /dev/nvme0n1
You are about to format nvme0n1, namespace 0x1.
WARNING: Format may irrevocably delete this device's data.
You have 10 seconds to press Ctrl-C to cancel this operation.

```

!!! warning
    This operation needs to be repeated for each NVMe device that will be handled by simplyblock.
