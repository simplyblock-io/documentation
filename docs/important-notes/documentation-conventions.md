## Feature Stages

Features in simplyblock are generally released when reaching general availability. However, sometimes, features are
made available earlier to receive feedback of testers. Those features need to be enabled specifically and are marked
in the documentation accordingly. Features without a specific label are considered ready for production.

The documentation uses the following feature stage labels:

- **General Availability:** This is the default stage if nothing else is defined on the feature. In this stage the
                            feature is **considered ready for production**.
- **Technical Preview:**    The feature is provided for testing and feedback acquisition. It is not considered stable
                            or complete. Breaking changes may occur which could break backward compatibility. Features
                            in this stage are **not considered ready for production**. Features in this stage need to
                            be specifically enabled before use.
