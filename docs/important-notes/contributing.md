# Contributing to Simplyblock Documentation

## Overview

Simplyblock's documentation is publicly available, and we welcome contributions from the community to improve clarity,
fix errors, and enhance the overall quality of our documentation. While simplyblock itself is not open source, our
documentation is publicly hosted  [GitHub](https://github.com/simplyblock-io/documentation). We encourage
users to provide feedback, report typos, suggest improvements, and submit fixes for documentation inconsistencies.

## How to Contribute

The simplyblock documentation is built using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), specifically using the
[mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) variant.

Changes to the documentation can be done by changing or adding the necessary Markdown files.
