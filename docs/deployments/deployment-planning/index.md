Proper deployment planning is essential for ensuring the performance, scalability, and resilience of a simplyblock
storage cluster.

Before installation, key factors such as node sizing, storage capacity, and fault tolerance mechanisms should be
carefully evaluated to match workload requirements. This section provides guidance on sizing management nodes and
storage nodes, helping administrators allocate adequate CPU, memory, and disk resources for optimal cluster performance.

Additionally, it explores selectable erasure coding schemes, detailing how different configurations impact storage
efficiency, redundancy, and recovery performance. Other critical considerations, such as network infrastructure,
high-availability strategies, and workload-specific optimizations, are also covered to assist in designing a simplyblock
deployment that meets both operational and business needs.
