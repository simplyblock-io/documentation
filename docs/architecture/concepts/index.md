Understanding the fundamental concepts behind simplyblock is essential for effectively utilizing its distributed storage
architecture. Simplyblock provides a cloud-native, software-defined storage solution that enables highly scalable,
high-performance storage for containerized and virtualized environments. By leveraging NVMe over TCP (NVMe/TCP) and
advanced data management features, simplyblock ensures low-latency access, high availability, and seamless scalability.
This documentation section provides detailed explanations of key storage concepts within Simplyblock, helping users
grasp how its storage components function and interact within a distributed system.

The concepts covered in this section include Logical Volumes (LVs), Snapshots, Clones, Hyper-Convergence,
Disaggregation, and more. Each concept plays a crucial role in optimizing storage performance, ensuring data durability,
and enabling efficient resource allocation. Whether you are deploying simplyblock in a Kubernetes environment, a
virtualized infrastructure, or a bare-metal setup, understanding these core principles will help you design, configure,
and manage your storage clusters effectively.

By familiarizing yourself with these concepts, you will gain insight into how simplyblock abstracts storage resources,
provides scalable and resilient data services, and integrates with modern cloud-native environments. This knowledge is
essential for leveraging Simplyblock to meet your organization's storage performance, reliability, and scalability
requirements.
