Hyper-converged storage is a key component of hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI), where compute, storage, and
networking resources are tightly integrated into a unified system. This approach simplifies management, enhances
scalability, and optimizes resource utilization in distributed data storage environments.

Traditional storage architectures often separate compute and storage into distinct hardware layers, requiring complex
management and specialized hardware. Hyper-converged storage consolidates these resources within the same nodes, forming
a software-defined storage (SDS) layer that dynamically distributes and manages data across the cluster.

Key characteristics of hyper-converged storage include:

- **Integrated Storage and Compute:** Storage resources are virtualized and distributed across the compute nodes,
  eliminating the need for dedicated storage arrays.
- **Scalability:** New nodes can be added seamlessly, increasing both compute and storage capacity without complex
  reconfiguration.
- **Software-Defined Storage (SDS):** A software layer abstracts and manages storage resources, enabling automation,
  fault tolerance, and efficiency.
- **High Availability and Resilience:** Data is replicated across nodes to ensure redundancy and fault tolerance,
  minimizing downtime.
- **Simplified Management:** A unified management interface enables streamlined provisioning, monitoring, and
  maintenance of storage and compute resources.
