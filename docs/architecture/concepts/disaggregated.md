Disaggregated storage represents a modern approach to distributed storage architectures, where compute and storage
resources are decoupled. This separation allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in managing data
across large-scale distributed environments.

Traditional storage architectures typically integrate compute and storage within the same nodes, leading to resource
contention and inefficiencies. Disaggregated storage solutions address these limitations by separating storage resources
from compute resources, enabling independent scaling of each component based on workload demands.

Key characteristics of disaggregated storage solutions include:

- **Independent Scalability:** Compute and storage can be scaled separately, optimizing resource utilization and
  reducing unnecessary hardware expansion.
- **Resource Efficiency:** Storage is pooled and accessible across multiple compute nodes, reducing data duplication and
  improving overall efficiency.
- **Improved Performance:** By reducing bottlenecks associated with tightly coupled storage, applications can achieve
  better latency and throughput.
- **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Different storage technologies (e.g., NVMe-over-Fabrics, object storage) can be
  integrated seamlessly, allowing organizations to adopt the best-fit storage solutions for specific workloads.
- **Simplified Management:** Centralized storage management reduces complexity, enabling easier provisioning,
  monitoring, and maintenance of storage resources.
