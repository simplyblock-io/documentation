Monitoring the health, performance, and resource utilization of a Simplyblock cluster is crucial for ensuring optimal
operation, early issue detection, and efficient capacity planning. The `sbcli-pre` command line interface provides a
comprehensive set of tools to retrieve real-time and historical metrics related to Logical Volumes (LVs), storage nodes,
I/O performance, and system status. By leveraging `sbcli-pre`, administrators can quickly diagnose bottlenecks, monitor
resource consumption, and maintain overall system stability.
