Ensuring data resilience and maintaining cluster health are critical aspects of managing a simplyblock storage
deployment. This section covers best practices for backing up and restoring individual volumes or entire clusters,
helping organizations safeguard their data against failures, corruption, or accidental deletions.

Additionally, simplyblock provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities using built-in Prometheus and Grafana for
real-time visualization of cluster health, I/O statistics, and performance metrics.

This section details how to configure and use these monitoring tools, ensuring optimal performance, early issue
detection, and proactive storage management in cloud-native and enterprise environments.
